# Mail-Guide-AI

---

Mail-Guide-AI is an intelligent customer service assistant designed to streamline and automate email management for Coperate and personal Email accounts. Built with Python and JavaScript, this project leverages advanced AI techniques to classify incoming emails into relevant sections and generate responsible, context-aware responses tailored for each category. Whether you're handling support tickets, customer feedback, or general inquiries, Mail-Guide-AI acts as your smart assistant, ensuring timely and accurate replies, improving customer satisfaction, and reducing manual workload.

## Key Features

- **Automated Email Classification**: Utilizes machine learning and AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) to sort emails into predefined sections such as support, sales, feedback, and more.
- **Intelligent Response Generation**: Crafts contextually appropriate and responsible replies for each classified section, reducing the need for manual intervention and support.
- **Seamless Gmail Integration**: Connects directly to Gmail accounts, fetching emails, processing them, and sending automated responses.
- **Customizable Categories**: Easily extend or modify the classification rules to fit your unique business requirements.

## Powered by the Postmark API

A standout feature of Mail-Guide-AI is its integration with the [Postmark API](https://postmarkapp.com/). The Postmark API is a robust platform for email delivery and processing, and in this project, it plays a central role in handling **inbound mail processing**. Here’s how Mail-Guide-AI leverages Postmark:

- **Inbound Email Routing**: Postmark receives incoming emails and securely forwards them to Mail-Guide-AI for analysis and response generation.
- **Webhook Integration**: The project sets up webhooks to process incoming emails in real time, ensuring minimal delay between receiving a message and generating a response.
- **Reliable Parsing**: Postmark’s parsing capabilities extract essential email components (sender, subject, body, attachments), providing Mail-Guide-AI with structured data to classify and respond efficiently.
- **Scalability & Deliverability**: With Postmark’s reliable infrastructure, Mail-Guide-AI can handle high volumes of incoming mail without compromising speed or accuracy.
